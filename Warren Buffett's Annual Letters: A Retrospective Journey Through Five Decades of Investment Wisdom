## The Announcement: A Tradition Comes to Close

In a transition that marks the end of one of the most influential traditions in modern capitalism, Warren Buffett, at age 95, will no longer pen Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder letter. Beginning in February 2025, this duty passes to his successor, Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 63, who will also assume the CEO role at year-end.

Buffett himself foreshadowed this moment in his 2024 letter: "It won't be long before Greg Abel replaces me as CEO and will be writing the annual letters."

The announcement brings a mixture of sadness and nostalgia—not unlike watching a cherished mentor retire after a lifetime of teaching. For millions of investors worldwide, the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholder letter was not merely a corporate filing; it was a **masterclass in business philosophy, a meditation on human behavior, and a compass for navigating the turbulent waters of capital markets**.

Though Buffett will still publish a Thanksgiving letter on November 10, 2025, addressed to his children and shareholders, and will remain as Chairman, the February letter—the one that distilled a year's worth of business results, investment decisions, and timeless wisdom—will no longer bear his distinctive voice.

This retrospective is a journey through five decades of that voice: the humor, the humility, the unflinching honesty, and the profound simplicity that made a textile company from Omaha into one of the most valuable enterprises in history, and made its annual reports required reading for anyone serious about understanding business and investing.

## The 1970s: The Beginning — From Textiles to Philosophy

### **March 1971: The First Letter**

In March 1971, Warren Buffett signed his name for the first time to the annual "letter to the stockholders" of Berkshire Hathaway.

When Buffett's management assumed responsibility in May 1965, the company's net worth was $22 million. By the mid-1970s, he had grown it to $92 million—a remarkable achievement, but one that came with hard-earned lessons.

### **The Textile Industry Struggle: A Lesson in Business Selection**

The defining theme of the 1970s letters was Buffett's candid, almost brutally honest, discussion of Berkshire's struggling textile business.

In one of his most famous metaphors, Buffett wrote:

> **"A horse that can count to ten is a remarkable horse—not a remarkable mathematician. Likewise, a textile company that allocates capital brilliantly within its industry is a remarkable textile company—but not a remarkable business."**

This was not the typical corporate language of obfuscation and excuse-making. Buffett was admitting, in plain English, that he had bought a **mediocre business**—and no amount of managerial brilliance could overcome the fundamental economics of a declining industry.

From this experience came one of Buffett's most enduring insights:

> **"A good managerial record (measured by economic returns) is far more a function of what business boat you get into than it is of how effectively you row."**

**Translation:** **Choose the right boat.** You can row your hardest in a leaky vessel and still sink. Better to choose a seaworthy ship and row with moderate effort.

### **The Insurance Pivot: Finding the Right Boat**

By the mid-1970s, Buffett had pivoted toward insurance. In his letters, he noted:

> **"We are highly pleased with the results of our insurance subsidiaries since their acquisition in March 1967."**

This was the beginning of Berkshire's transformation from a failing textile mill into an **insurance-powered conglomerate**. The insurance model provided **float**—premiums collected upfront that could be invested before claims were paid—creating a self-reinforcing cycle of capital accumulation.

**Historic Context:** The 1970s were marked by stagflation (high inflation + high unemployment), the 1973-1974 stock market crash (S&P 500 fell ~48%), and the end of the Bretton Woods system. In this turbulent environment, Buffett's focus on **durable business economics** over short-term market noise was prescient.

## The 1980s: The Efficient Market Heresy and the Power of Patience

### **The Efficient Market Theory Challenge**

The 1980s saw the rise of academic finance theory—particularly the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), which claimed that stock prices always reflect all available information, making it impossible to "beat the market."

Buffett, with characteristic bluntness, dismissed this as nonsense:

> **"Witness the tenacity with which almost all clung to the theory of efficient markets throughout the 1970s and 1980s, dismissively calling powerful facts that refuted it 'anomalies.'"**

His letters during this decade served as a **counterweight to the academic consensus**, arguing that markets are frequently inefficient due to human psychology—fear, greed, herd behavior—and that patient, disciplined investors could exploit these inefficiencies.

### **The "Wonderful Company at a Fair Price" Evolution**

In the 1980s, Buffett's investment philosophy evolved from his Graham-ian roots (buying "cigar butts"—cheap, mediocre companies trading below liquidation value) to a focus on **quality at reasonable prices**.

He wrote:

> **"It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price, than a fair company at a wonderful price."**

This shift was influenced by his partnership with Charlie Munger, who taught Buffett to appreciate **business quality**—durable competitive advantages, pricing power, strong management—over statistical cheapness alone.

**Case in point:** Berkshire's purchases of The Washington Post (1973), See's Candies (1972), and Coca-Cola (1988-1989) exemplified this philosophy. These were not "cheap" in the traditional sense, but they possessed **enduring moats**—competitive advantages that allowed them to compound value over decades.

### **Historic Context: The 1987 Crash**

On October 19, 1987—"Black Monday"—the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 22.6% in a single day, the largest one-day percentage decline in history.

Buffett's response, captured in subsequent letters, was characteristically calm:

> **"Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy only when others are fearful."**

While others panicked, Buffett saw opportunity. This temperament—the ability to remain rational when markets are irrational—became a hallmark of his philosophy.

## The 1990s: The Dot-Com Bubble and Staying Within Your Circle

### **The Rise of the Tech Bubble**

The 1990s were defined by the internet revolution and the subsequent dot-com bubble. By 1999, technology stocks were trading at stratospheric valuations, with companies that had never turned a profit commanding billion-dollar market caps.

Buffett, conspicuously, stayed out.

### **The Circle of Competence Principle**

In his letters during this period, Buffett articulated one of his most important investment principles:

> **"You only have to be able to evaluate companies within your circle of competence. The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital."**

He continued:

> **"What an investor needs is the ability to correctly evaluate selected businesses. You must also resist the temptation to stray…"**

Buffett admitted he didn't understand how to value internet businesses. He couldn't determine which would succeed, which would fail, or what a "fair price" might be. So, **he didn't invest**.

For this, he was widely mocked. The media criticized him as "out of touch," "too old," and "missing the new economy."

### **The Bubble Bursts: Vindication**

Then, in March 2000, the bubble burst. The NASDAQ Composite, which had peaked at 5,048 in March 2000, fell to 1,114 by October 2002—a **78% decline**.

Buffett's refusal to chase the bubble was vindicated. His letters during and after the crash were characteristically gracious—no "I told you so," but rather:

> **"Your goal as an investor should simply be to purchase, at a rational price, a part interest in an easily-understandable business whose earnings are virtually certain to be materially higher five, ten and twenty years from now."**

**Lesson:** Discipline trumps brilliance. It's better to miss an opportunity outside your competence than to lose capital chasing trends you don't understand.

## The 2000s: Derivatives, the Financial Crisis, and the "Weapons of Mass Destruction"

### **The 2002 Letter: The Famous Warning**

In Berkshire Hathaway's 2002 annual letter, Buffett issued one of the most prescient warnings of his career:

> **"In our view, however, derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction, carrying dangers that, while now latent, are potentially lethal."**

**Context:** Berkshire had acquired General Re, which came with General Re Securities—a derivatives dealer. Buffett and Munger didn't want it, judging it dangerous, but closing down a derivatives business proved extraordinarily difficult, taking many years.

Buffett wrote:

> **"We try to be alert to any sort of mega-catastrophe risk, and that posture may make us unduly appreciative about the burgeoning quantities of long-term derivatives contracts and the massive amount of uncollateralized receivables that are growing alongside."**

### **The 2008 Financial Crisis: Prophecy Fulfilled**

Six years later, the global financial system collapsed.

Derivatives—particularly mortgage-backed securities and credit default swaps—played a central role in the crisis. At their peak, total over-the-counter (OTC) derivative value hit just shy of **$35 trillion** in the second half of 2008, just months before Lehman Brothers collapsed in September.

Buffett's 2002 warning was vindicated in the most catastrophic way possible.

### **The Irony: Buffett's Own Use of Derivatives**

What made Buffett's critique so powerful was his willingness to acknowledge complexity and even contradiction. In the same 2002 letter, he wrote:

> **"Indeed, at Berkshire, I sometimes engage in large-scale derivatives transactions in order to facilitate certain investment strategies."**

Between 2004 and 2008, Buffett sold **$4.9 billion in put options** on major indices, earning premiums upfront and betting that markets would be higher in 10-15 years.

**The difference:** Buffett understood the risks, sized his positions appropriately, and had the capital to survive worst-case scenarios. Most institutions did not.

**Lesson:** The danger of derivatives is not the instruments themselves but the **leverage, complexity, and interconnectedness** that can turn small problems into systemic crises.

### **The 2008 Letter: Optimism Amid Ruin**

In the depths of the 2008-2009 crisis, with the S&P 500 down ~57% from its peak, Buffett's 2008 letter struck a tone of sober optimism:

> **"Though the path has not been smooth, our economic system has worked extraordinarily well over time. It has unleashed human potential as no other system has, and it will continue to do so."**

While others panicked, Buffett invested. Berkshire injected capital into Goldman Sachs, General Electric, and Bank of America—deals that would generate billions in profits.

**Historic lesson:** Crises create opportunities for those with capital, courage, and a long-term perspective.

## The 2010s: Recovery, Reflection, and the Durability of Moats

### **The Economic Moat Concept**

In his 2007 letter (published in early 2008, before the crisis), Buffett articulated one of his most influential concepts:

> **"A truly great business must have an enduring 'moat' that protects excellent returns on invested capital."**

He continued:

> **"The dynamics of capitalism guarantee that competitors will repeatedly assault any business 'castle' that is earning high returns. Therefore a formidable barrier such as a company's being the low-cost producer (GEICO, Costco) or possessing a powerful world-wide brand (Coca-Cola, Gillette, American Express) is essential for sustained success."**

And then, critically:

> **"A moat that must be continuously rebuilt will eventually be no moat at all."**

**Translation:** Look for businesses with **structural competitive advantages**—not those dependent on constant innovation or fleeting trends.

### **The 2010s: A Decade of Steady Compounding**

The 2010s were characterized by a long bull market following the 2008-2009 crisis. Buffett's letters during this period reflected **maturity and reflection**—less about dramatic investment coups and more about:

1. **Corporate governance:** Buffett frequently criticized excessive executive compensation and misaligned incentives that prioritize short-term stock performance over long-term business health.

2. **Share buybacks:** Berkshire began repurchasing its own shares in 2011 (after decades of refusing to do so), signaling Buffett's belief that the stock was undervalued.

3. **Apple:** Berkshire's massive investment in Apple (beginning in 2016) became one of its largest holdings, demonstrating that even a 90-year-old investor could adapt—Apple was, in many ways, a "wonderful business" with an enduring moat (ecosystem lock-in, brand loyalty, pricing power).

### **The Stock Market Metaphor**

One of Buffett's most enduring quotes, repeated frequently in the 2010s letters, encapsulated his philosophy:

> **"The stock market is designed to transfer money from the active to the patient."**

**Lesson:** Trading is a losing game. Ownership is a winning game. Buy great businesses and hold them.

## The 2020s: Pandemic, Reflection, and the Final Letters

### **The 2020 Letter: The Pandemic Response**

When the COVID-19 pandemic struck in early 2020, markets plunged ~34% in a matter of weeks. Buffett's 2019 letter (published in February 2020, just before the crash) emphasized Berkshire's **financial strength**:

> **"Berkshire will forever remain a financial fortress."**

And indeed, Berkshire weathered the storm with ease, its $128 billion cash hoard providing optionality and stability.

### **The 2024 Letter: Foreshadowing the Transition**

In his 2024 letter—likely his last as CEO—Buffett wrote with characteristic humility:

> **"It won't be long before Greg Abel replaces me as CEO and will be writing the annual letters."**

The letter was not a victory lap but a **quiet acknowledgment of mortality and succession**. Buffett reflected on the importance of **corporate culture**, the value of **long-term thinking**, and the necessity of **trust and integrity** in business.

He also wrote about his children and the Buffett Foundation, signaling that his attention was turning toward **legacy beyond capital**.

## Timeless Principles: The Enduring Philosophy of the Philosopher-Capitalist

Over five decades, certain themes recurred in Buffett's letters—principles that transcended market cycles, economic regimes, and technological revolutions.

### **1. Temperament Over Intelligence**

> **"Success in investing doesn't correlate with IQ.... What you need is the temperament to control the urges that get other people into trouble in investing."**

**Lesson:** Emotional discipline—the ability to resist fear and greed—is more important than raw intellect.

### **2. Owner's Mentality**

> **"Your goal as an investor should simply be to purchase, at a rational price, a part interest in an easily-understandable business..."**

**Lesson:** Think like an **owner**, not a trader. Ask: "Would I buy this entire business at this price?"

### **3. The Importance of Management and Governance**

Buffett was a fierce advocate for ethical corporate governance and competent leadership. He wrote:

> **"When a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for bad economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact."**

**Lesson:** Great managers can't fix fundamentally flawed businesses. Choose good businesses first, good managers second.

### **4. Long-Term Perspective**

> **"Our favorite holding period is forever."**

**Lesson:** Compounding works best over decades, not quarters. Minimize turnover. Let great businesses compound.

### **5. Margin of Safety**

Inherited from Benjamin Graham, Buffett emphasized:

> **"It is not necessary to do extraordinary things to get extraordinary results."**

**Lesson:** Buy assets below intrinsic value. The gap between price and value is your margin of safety.

### **6. Humility and Continuous Learning**

Despite his success, Buffett's letters were marked by **intellectual humility**:

> **"Charlie and I have not learned how to solve difficult business problems. What we have learned is to avoid them."**

**Lesson:** Know what you don't know. Avoiding mistakes is often more important than hitting home runs.

## The Final Lesson: The Power of Clear Communication

Beyond investment principles, Buffett's letters taught a meta-lesson: **the power of clear, honest communication**.

In an era of corporate jargon, euphemism, and obfuscation, Buffett wrote like he was talking to his sisters—clearly, directly, and with humor.

Examples:

- **On bad acquisitions:** "When a management with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for bad economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact."

- **On market volatility:** "Volatility is not synonymous with risk."

- **On diversification:** "Wide diversification is only required when investors do not understand what they are doing."

His letters were **never boring**. They were filled with baseball metaphors, insurance anecdotes, and self-deprecating humor about his mistakes (like buying Berkshire Hathaway itself—a "200-billion-dollar mistake").

**Lesson for all communicators:** Clarity is kindness. Simplicity is sophistication. Honesty builds trust.

## Conclusion: Passing the Torch to Greg Abel

As Warren Buffett steps back from writing the annual letter, it is worth reflecting on what made these letters so extraordinary.

**They were not just investor updates—they were a 50-year MBA course delivered one letter at a time.**

They taught:
- How to think about risk.
- How to evaluate businesses.
- How to manage emotions.
- How to build a life of integrity and purpose.

Greg Abel inherits not just a company but a **tradition of transparency, wisdom, and service to shareholders**.

The question is not whether Abel can replicate Buffett's voice—no one can. The question is whether he can uphold the **principles** that made the letters valuable: honesty, clarity, long-term thinking, and a commitment to treat shareholders as partners.

## Postscript: A Personal Reflection

For those of us who have read these letters over the years—whether as young investors trying to understand markets, or as seasoned professionals seeking wisdom—the announcement brings a pang of loss.

Buffett's letters were a **lighthouse in the fog**—a steady beacon when markets were chaotic, a source of calm when panic reigned, and a reminder that business, at its best, is about creating value for customers, employees, and shareholders alike.

The letters will remain available on Berkshire's website, a permanent archive of five decades of thought. We can return to them, as we return to favorite books, finding new insights with each reading.

But the act of **anticipating** the new letter each February—wondering what Buffett would say about the current crisis, the latest fad, the state of American business—that ritual is ending.

And so we say: **Thank you, Warren Buffett**, for 54 years of teaching.

Thank you for showing that capitalism, practiced with integrity, can be a force for good.

Thank you for proving that clarity, humility, and humor are not weaknesses but strengths.

And thank you for reminding us, year after year, that the best investment is in **yourself—your temperament, your judgment, and your character**.

The letters may end, but the lessons endure.
