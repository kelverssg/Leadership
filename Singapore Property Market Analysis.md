## Part 1: Analysis of Market Dynamics and Future Scenario

This analysis first reviews the causal feedback loops in the Singapore property market and then explores the potential impact of a sharp expansion in BTO (Build-To-Order) public housing supply while restricting private land sales.

### A Robust Review of the Core Causal Loop Reasoning

The core model posits that restricted government land sales (GLS) create a cascading price appreciation from new launch condos to the resale HDB market. This is a sound framework.

**1. GLS Restriction → High New Launch Prices**
*   **Affirmation:** This is the foundational truth. As the primary seller of land, the government's control over the GLS programme sets a floor on land prices. High demand against a restricted supply leads to high bids from developers, who pass these costs to buyers.
*   **Nuance:** The government also uses GLS as a macro-prudential tool for market stability, not just for short-term revenue maximization.

**2. New Launch Prices → Drag-Up Resale Condo Prices**
*   **Affirmation:** This link is very strong. New launches serve as a pricing benchmark and psychological anchor for the entire private market, giving existing sellers the confidence to ask for more.
*   **Nuance:** The effect isn't perfectly linear. The price gap depends on the age and quality of the resale property. Other factors like interest rates and economic sentiment can also weaken or strengthen this link.

**3. Resale Condo Prices → Drag-Up Resale HDB Prices**
*   **Affirmation:** This "wealth effect" is significant. As private property becomes more expensive, HDB owners' upgrading aspirations are recalibrated, prompting them to ask for higher prices for their own flats to bridge the gap.
*   **Nuance:** The HDB resale market has unique drivers, such as the Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP), school proximity, and government grants, which can cause price variations independent of the private market.

**4. BTO Decoupling & The "Lottery Effect"**
*   **Affirmation:** This is a brilliant and accurate observation. BTOs are sold at a subsidy, creating a massive arbitrage opportunity upon reaching the Minimum Occupation Period (MOP). A BTO bought for $450,000 might have a market value of $750,000+ after five years.
*   **Impact:** This "lottery effect" is a powerful engine for the entire cycle. The paper gains from BTOs become the tangible capital that fuels demand for more expensive resale HDBs and entry-level condos.

### Impact of a Sharp BTO Expansion Amidst Sustained GLS Restriction

This scenario involves pushing two key government levers in opposite directions. The likely outcome is a significant bifurcation of the market.

**1. Impact on the HDB Market (BTO & Resale)**
*   **Cooling the "Lottery Effect":** Higher BTO supply would increase the certainty of getting a flat, diminishing the perception of BTOs as a "lottery" and shifting the focus from prize-winning to home-getting.
*   **Softening the HDB Resale Market:** By satisfying more first-timer demand directly, the BTO expansion would remove a large pool of buyers from the resale market, leading to lower Cash Over Valuation (COV) and price stagnation, especially for older flats.
*   **Long-Term MOP Supply:** A decade later, a massive wave of these new BTOs reaching MOP would introduce a huge supply into the resale market, further suppressing price growth.

**2. Impact on the Private Condo Market (A Tale of Two Markets)**
This is where two opposing forces collide: reduced upgrader demand (from BTO expansion) and restricted land supply (from GLS policy).
*   **Mass-Market / Outside Central Region (OCR) Condos:** This segment, the primary target for HDB upgraders, would see demand soften considerably. Price growth would likely stagnate as the urgency for HDB owners to upgrade diminishes.
*   **Prime / Core Central Region (CCR) & Luxury Condos:** This segment would be largely insulated. Its buyers are typically not HDB upgraders. The sustained GLS restriction would be the dominant factor, making prime land scarce and driving prices up for this "trophy asset" class.

**Overall Conclusion for Part 1:**
The proposed scenario would likely cleave the property market in two. It would stabilize the public housing market for the majority while making private property, especially at the high end, an even more exclusive and stratified asset class. This would achieve the political goal of calming the mass market while preserving the nation's land value through the high-end market.

## Part 2 (Updated November 2025): Household Income and Housing Affordability Model

This model maps housing affordability to Singapore's population, from public housing up to the most exclusive property tiers. It uses the "7x annual income" metric for the general population and incorporates real-world benchmarks for the apex tiers, illustrating the shift from income-based to wealth-based purchasing power.

*Data sources: SingStat 2024 household income, HDB resale Q2 2025, COMPASS salary benchmarks (Aug 2025), executive compensation 2024.*

### Section A: The Main Property Ladder (Deciles 1-9)

This section covers the majority of the population, whose purchasing power is primarily driven by their household income.

**Household Income Data (SingStat, 2024)**
*   **Median (5th Decile):** S$11,297 / month
*   **9th Decile (Top 20%):** S$23,620 / month (interpolated from 10th decile S$34,489)
*   **Bottom 10% (1st Decile):** S$2,434 / month

**Affordability Mapping (7x Annual Income)**

| Housing Segment | Target Income Decile (Est.) | Avg. Monthly Household Income | **Estimated Affordable Price (7x Annual Income)** | **Actual Market Price (2024-2025)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2-Room / 3-Room HDB** | 1st - 4th | $2,400 - $6,000 | **~$200,000 - $500,000** | $300,000 - $450,000 |
| **4-Room / 5-Room HDB** | 5th - 7th | $11,300 - $15,000 | **~$950,000 - $1,260,000** | $600,000 - $850,000 |
| **Exec / Large HDB** | 8th | ~$18,000 - $20,000 | **~$1,510,000 - $1,680,000** | $900,000 - $1,300,000 |
| **Entry-Level Condo** | 9th | ~$23,600 | **~$1,980,000** | $1,500,000 - $2,200,000 |

**Analysis:** The 2024 data shows improved affordability across all segments due to household income growth (+22% for median, +19% for 9th decile) outpacing property price increases. The median household (S$11,297/month) can now comfortably afford the Q2 2025 HDB median price of S$604k for a 4-room flat, with S$950k in purchasing power under the 7x rule.

The "Great Chasm" between public and private housing persists but has narrowed slightly. The 9th decile household (S$23,620/month) now has S$1.98M in purchasing power, placing entry-level OCR condos (S$1.5-2.2M) within reach at the upper bound of affordability. This represents a positive shift from 2023 baseline, where the 9th decile was at the lower bound (S$1.66M) of entry-level condo pricing.

### Section B: Apex Tiers - From High Income to High Net Worth

This is the domain of the top 1-2% of the population. Here, the 7x income rule begins to fray and is eventually replaced entirely by a wealth-based acquisition model.

**High-Income & High-Net-Worth Benchmarks:**
*   **Top Civil Servant / Minister (MR4 Grade):** Annual salary benchmark is **~S$1.1 Million**.
*   **Top Local Bank CEO (e.g., DBS):** Annual remuneration is **~S$17.6 Million** (2024 actual figure).
*   **Prominent HNW Naturalized Citizen (e.g., Eduardo Saverin):** Net worth is benchmarked in the **billions (e.g., S$15-20 Billion+).**

**Apex Tier Affordability Model**

| Housing Tier | Typical Price Range (SGD) | Benchmark Profile | Est. Annual Income / Net Worth | Affordability Logic |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Inter-Terrace / Strata Landed** | **$4M - $7M** | Director at MNC / Law or Medical Partner | **~$600k - $1M p.a.** | **Income-Driven:** Achievable at ~7x income for the top 1-2% of earners. A high annual income is the primary enabler. |
| **Semi-Detached House** | **$7M - $12M** | Top Civil Servant / Minister (MR4) | **~$1.1M - $2.2M p.a.** | **High-Income Driven:** Very comfortable purchase at 4x-6x annual income. The salary itself is sufficient to secure financing and service the debt easily. |
| **Detached Bungalow (non-GCB)** | **$12M - $25M** | CEO of Local Bank / Top Surgeon | **~$15M - $20M p.a.** | **Hybrid (Income & Wealth):** The 7x rule is now irrelevant. The purchase is funded by a single year's bonus, vested stock options, or a small portion of accumulated wealth. |
| **Good Class Bungalow (GCB)** | **$30M - $100M+** | Forbes-listed Billionaire (e.g., Tech Founder, Tycoon) | **Net Worth: >S$5 Billion** | **Wealth-Driven:** Purchase is a rounding error on their net worth, not an income consideration. A S$50M GCB is **1%** of a S$5B net worth, akin to an average person buying a S$5,000 luxury item. |

**Analysis of the Apex Tiers:**

The data clearly shows a fundamental shift in purchasing logic.

*   For **Terrace and Semi-Detached homes**, a very high, stable *income* is the key. The buyers are top professionals whose annual earnings can comfortably support the mortgage.

    *COMPASS Reality Check (Aug 2025):* COMPASS 90th percentile benchmarks for senior roles: S$369k (Banking), S$486k (Fund Management), S$273k (Professional Services). Applying **power couple dynamics** (1.5x multiplier to account for dual high-earner households), the adjusted purchasing power becomes:

    - **Banking power couple:** S$369k × 1.5 = **S$554k p.a.** → S$3.88M affordability (7x)
    - **Fund Management power couple:** S$486k × 1.5 = **S$729k p.a.** → S$5.1M affordability (7x)

    This places power couples at COMPASS 90th percentile firmly within the **Inter-Terrace tier (S$4-7M)**, validating the original income assumption. The S$600k-1M band is achievable through dual senior professional incomes (two Managing Directors, two equity partners, or senior professional + C-suite combinations) rather than requiring a single ultra-high earner. This more accurately reflects the typical buyer profile for landed property in this segment.

*   For **Detached Bungalows**, the logic shifts to *hybrid*. While the annual income is astronomical, the purchase is often funded by a liquidity event (a large bonus, sale of stock) rather than a traditional mortgage based on a salary multiple.
*   For **Good Class Bungalows**, income is functionally irrelevant. This is a wealth preservation and status asset. The decision is akin to acquiring a major piece of art. The purchase price is evaluated as a percentage of total net worth, not as a multiple of annual earnings. This is a completely different financial universe, which is why GCBs can be transacted even when interest rates are high, as financing is often not the primary concern.
